# My-Excel-Project
This project presents an analytical dashboard built using Excel to explore product performance, customer engagement, and pricing strategies from a synthetic Amazon product dataset.

## Overview
The dataset simulates product listings and customer reviews similar to those on Amazon. The goal of this Excel dashboard is to:

- Provide product insights by category

- Analyze discount strategies

- Correlate ratings with review volume

- Identify top-performing products


 ### Additional calculated fields:
  1. potential_revenue = actual_price × rating_count
  2. rating_score = rating × rating_count
  3. price_bucket = Categorized actual prices into ranges


### PivotTables
- Average discount by category
- Review and rating counts by category
- Product-wise average ratings and review volumes
- Potential revenue analysis
- Product distribution by price range
